ðŸŒ‡ Scenario
You are working in an event-driven system where messages are emitted onto an event bus. A worker service processes these events in real time, performing key calculations. However, an issue has occurred:
Some events were missed or processed incorrectly due to an error.
You now need to recalculate the results without relying on a traditional database for storing historical event data.
